    <h2> Who Am I ? </h2>
      <p> My name is <b> Nicolas Bolinaga </b> i was born in 1999 in Caracas the capital of Venezuela. </br>
          I graduated high school and went off to study Mechanical Engineering in <i>"Universidad Metropolitana".</i></br>
          A year passed and  I decided to put a hold on college and move here, to <b>Seattle</b>, to pursue a career in Front-End Development</br>
          After I'm finished I would like to go back and get my degree in engineering, but only time will tell.
