    <h1> Semantic Elements </h1>
    <p> To understand what a Semantic Element in HTML is first we need to define two things; One what’s a HTML element, and two what is the meaning of the word semantic.</br>
        According to W3C <i>“an element is the basic building block of HTML and is typically made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag”</i>. So basically, all HTML code is made of a bunch of elements. Some examples of elements are <b>< div >, < h1 >, < p ></b>, and many more.</br>
        Semantic is defined as <i>“of or relating to meaning in language”</i> by the Merriam Webster Dictionary.</br>
        So, when we talk about Semantic Elements in HTML we are referring to an element that has meaning for both the browser and the developer. For example, <b>< article ></b> is a semantic element since it can be understood by both the machine and the person.</br>
